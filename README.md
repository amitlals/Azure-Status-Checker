# Azure-Status-Checker
<b>Chrome Extension | Edge Add-on </b>helps you to check the Live status of Azure Resources and services globally on your Chrome/Edge Broswer. With the Azure Status Checker, you can easily view the status of all your Azure resources right from your browser. A convenient green or red icon will immediately inform you of any outages or issues, along with a pop-up screen showing the availability of services by region. No longer will you need to manually refresh the Azure status page or scroll through long lists â€“ all the information you need is just a click away. <br>

But the benefits of the Azure Status Checker don't stop there. By quickly identifying and addressing any issues, you can ensure that your workloads are running smoothly on the resilient foundation of the Azure cloud platform. This extension is a must-have for any business utilizing the Azure cloud platform, as it offers transparency and reliability for your workloads. It is completely free to download, and I welcome any feedback or comments you may have on its development.
<br><br>
Thank you for considering the Azure Status Checker, and I hope it helps to make your year on the Azure cloud platform a successful and smooth one.
